Istio is a tool that provides service mesh capabilities
it has network proxy, it takes all your un-encripted requests traffic it will process and encrypt that and send it to the pods it will encrypt(mtls) all the engress traffic

Istio is an open framework for connecting, securing, managing and monitoring microservices
 istio includes
1. service discovery
2. load balancing
3. failure recovery
4. tele-metrics
5. monitoring
 istio can also handle more complex operational requirements
1. A/B testing
2. canary releases
3. rate limiting
4. dark launches
5. access control
6. end-to-end authentication

what makes istio so unique is that all these functionalities come with no change of code required
istio is diveded into two parts control plane and data plane
control plane has 3 important components pilot, citadel, galley  together all are istiod
pilot handles all the configuration and programming of nyproxy side car and some of the responsibilities is  abserving the service topology, traffic shifting, fault injecction, requesting routing, mirroring
citadel provides you keys and certificates to enable secure communication and secure connection between services it also provides strong service to service and end user authentication using mtls(mutual transport
layer security)
Galley 
the main responsibility of control plane is it enables secure access and communication between services in a policy driven way
data plane is implemented in such a way that it intercepts all inbound and outbound traffic from services like loadbalancer or nodeport whichever the service you are using it will intercept all the traffic
