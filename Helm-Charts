this packaging concept of helm is helmchart basically it is a chart wherein there is a couple of multiple files like deployment files, service files...... and you will have a centralized location for managing
things 
and also like you deployed nginx and tommorow their is a upgrade and you dont have to go to any of the file using helm command all the helm commands you can execute the helm command and you can do the nginx upgrade
